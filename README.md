## Project Description:

MundusVR is a proof of concept for a virtual reality content creation application. A user that wants to record and share a story through an immersive environment can now do so through virtual reality. 

Through its use case, it allows interactions to be done using physical hands thanks to the implementation of the leap motion hand tracking sensor to freely:

1. Create a custom environment: With options to change the sky and ground textures and terraforming the plance through a diorama.
2. Create Content: With a virtual toolbelt that hovers and follows you with a UI of placing 3D objects, teleporting and all other menus.
3. Create a 360 Video recording: With capabilities of invoking a virtual camera and microphone to record yourself in the environment. 

Today, mixed reality is an emerging technology that is expected to have high demands in various applications. Therefore, we wanted to give an example on how it can further be used as a content creator platform for everyone. Much like YouTube these days is famous for generated 2D video content through the web, immersive technologies have the same vision to detonate an explosion of freely generated content but in more dimensions (3D, 4D) through virtual reality. And that is essentially the ultimate use case for an application like this to evolve.

We enjoyed working on every aspect of this project. Special thanks to the University of Colorado Boulder and the ATLAS Community for making this possible.

Thank you.
