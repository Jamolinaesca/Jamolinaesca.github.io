## Project Description:

MundusVR is a proof of concept for a virtual reality content creation application. A user that wants to record and share a story through an immersive environment can now do so through virtual reality. It allows interactions to be done using physical hands thanks to the implementation of the leap motion hand tracking sensor to freely create a custom environment.

Today, mixed reality is an emerging technology that is expected to have high demands in various applications. Therefore, we wanted to give an example on how it can further be used as a content creator platform for everyone. Much like YouTube these days is famous for generated 2D video content through the web, immersive technologies have the same vision to detonate an explosion of freely generated content but in more dimensions (3D, 4D) through virtual reality. And that is essentially the ultimate use case for an application like this to evolve.

We enjoyed working on every aspect of this project. Special thanks to the University of Colorado Boulder and the ATLAS Community for making this possible.

Thank you.
